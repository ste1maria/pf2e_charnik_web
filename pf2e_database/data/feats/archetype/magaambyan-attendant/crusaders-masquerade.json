You become Concealed to undead using vision or lifesense, allowing you to Hide and Sneak without other sources of cover or concealment. This effect lasts only as long as you continue to take no actions other than to Hide, Sneak, Recall Knowledge, Command an Animal to direct your mask familiar, or other surreptitious actions. The GM determines which actions end the effect, but attacking, casting spells, activating items, and the like always do.</p>"
