If you critically succeed at a blowgun Strike using a poisoned dart, the target's initial save against the poison is one degree of success worse than the creature rolls; this is a misfortune effect.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you make a blowgun Strike while Hidden or Undetected, you don't automatically become Observed. Instead, immediately attempt a @Check[stealth|against:perception] check against the Perception DC of the target. If you succeed, you don't become observed, and are hidden (if you were undetected, you still become hidden rather than remaining undetected).</p>"
