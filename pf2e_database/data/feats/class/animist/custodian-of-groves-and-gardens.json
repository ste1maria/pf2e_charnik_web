      "value": "<p>Custodians of groves and gardens frequent tended greenery and farmlands cared for by loving stewards, and other places of reflection and restoration where green things grow. Some of these apparitions linger in the mortal realms not because they have lost their way, but because they believe they have already found Elysium. Others are the cultivated spiritual essence of the location itself. Custodians of groves and gardens are peaceful, quiet, and averse to conflict.</p><hr /><p><strong>Apparition Skills</strong> Farming Lore, Herbalism Lore</p>\n<p><strong>Apparition Spells</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cantrip</strong> Tangle Vine</li><li><strong>1st</strong> Protector Tree</li><li><strong>2nd</strong> Gentle Breeze</li><li><strong>3rd</strong> Safe Passage</li><li><strong>4th</strong> Peaceful Bubble</li><li><strong>5th</strong> Truespeech</li><li><strong>6th</strong> Field of Life</li><li><strong>7th</strong> Lifewood Cage</li><li><strong>8th</strong> Moment of Renewal</li><li><strong>9th</strong> Nature's Enmity</li></ul><p><strong>Vessel Spell</strong> Garden of Healing</p>\n<p><strong>Avatar</strong> <em>Peaceful Reaches</em> Speed 60 feet, ignore difficult terrain and greater difficult terrain</p>\n<p><strong>Melee</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> garden's cradle (agile, nonlethal, reach 10 feet, trip), <strong>Damage</strong> @Damage[(6d6+6)[bludgeoning]] plus Grab</p>\n<p><strong>Ranged</strong> <span class=\"action-glyph\">1</span> impose peace (nonlethal, range 120 feet), <strong>Damage</strong> @Damage[(6d6+6)[mental]]</p>"
