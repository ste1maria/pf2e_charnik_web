Within this range, you don't need to succeed at a flat check to target a Concealed creature, you're not Off-Guard to creatures that are Hidden from you (unless you're off-guard to them for reasons other than the hidden condition), and you need only a successful @Check[flat|dc:5] to target a hidden creature. Beyond 30 feet, the visions become overwhelmed with too many possible futures, making all of your senses imprecise beyond this range. The visions persist for 1 minute.</p>"
