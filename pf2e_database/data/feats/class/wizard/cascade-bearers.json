      "value": "<p>Cascade Bearers spend considerable time studying the qualities of magic itself as they seek to advance magical theory. They prize imagination and often bring a sense of playful curiosity to what would otherwise be intense inquiries at the borders of known magic. Of all the branches, these students are most likely to become teachers and to continue their research after graduation. In fact, some Cascade Bearers never leave the Magaambya, whether or not they attain an official teaching or research post. Their coursework draws broadly across the uses of magic, including attacking, protecting, manipulating objects, and seeing through matter.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Curriculum</strong></p><ul><li><strong>cantrips:</strong> Telekinetic Projectile</li><li><strong>1st:</strong> Force Barrage, Mystic Armor</li><li><strong>2nd:</strong> Telekinetic Maneuver</li><li><strong>3rd:</strong> Levitate</li><li><strong>4th:</strong> Flicker</li><li><strong>5th:</strong> Telekinetic Haul</li><li><strong>6th:</strong> Cursed Metamorphosis</li><li><strong>7th:</strong> Contingency, Project Image</li><li><strong>8th:</strong> Pinpoint</li><li><strong>9th:</strong> Detonate Magic</li></ul>"
