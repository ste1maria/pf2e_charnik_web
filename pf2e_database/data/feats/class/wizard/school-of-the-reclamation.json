Your study of magic in the service of rediscovering lost knowledge for the Sarkoris Reclamation has taught you that much that was once lost can still be found, but only if someone is willing to seek it out and retrieve it. You've focused your magic on reaching the world's hidden and forgotten places, whether they are found in a distant ruin or the depths of a lost memory, and bringing their knowledge back to the surfaceâ€”whatever the cost.</p>\n<p><strong>Curriculum</strong></p><ul><li><strong>cantrips:</strong> Telekinetic Hand, Telekinetic Projectile</li><li><strong>1st:</strong> Fleet Step, Gust of Wind, Mending</li><li><strong>2nd:</strong> Knock, Mental Map</li><li><strong>3rd:</strong> Locate, Overwhelming Memory</li><li><strong>4th:</strong> Bridge of Vines, Shape Stone</li><li><strong>5th:</strong> Mind Probe, Scouting Eye</li><li><strong>6th:</strong> Truesight, Wall of Force</li><li><strong>7th:</strong> Restore Ground, Retrocognition</li><li><strong>8th:</strong> Pinpoint, Unrelenting Observation</li><li><strong>9th:</strong> Metamorphosis</li></ul><p><strong>School Spells</strong> initial: Grasping Vine; advanced: Unsettling Knowledge</p>"
