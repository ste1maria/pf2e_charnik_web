      "value": "<p>Uzunjati are perhaps the most iconic Magaambyans, and certainly the best known beyond the Mwangi Expanse, because they are the storytellers who roam across Golarion gathering knowledge embedded in oral traditions and folklore. While they often travel as widely as Rain-Scribes, their focus is substantially different, for their exploration is always in service to collecting and preserving the spoken knowledge of community and culture. In addition to the magic of their own stories, they emphasize magic that protects and that affects others' minds.</p>\n<p><strong>Additional Curriculum</strong></p><ul><li><strong>cantrips:</strong> Daze</li><li><strong>1st:</strong> Mindlink, Ventriloquism</li><li><strong>2nd:</strong> Kgalaserke's Axes</li><li><strong>3rd:</strong> Ibex's Harvest</li><li><strong>4th:</strong> Telepathy</li><li><strong>5th:</strong> Mind Probe, Truespeech</li><li><strong>6th:</strong> Mislead</li><li><strong>7th:</strong> Retrocognition</li><li><strong>8th:</strong> Hidden Mind</li><li><strong>9th:</strong> Phantasmagoria</li></ul>"
